BMP2SCRIPT v40 by bOOMLINDE
-----------------------
Converts a BMP image to a macro loadable by Ephialtes' macro saver.

Usage: bmp2script.exe <image.bmp>
You can also drag the bitmaps to the program icon to convert them.

+ The image has to be a 24 bit windows bitmap.
+ Any image size up to 255x255 is theoretically supported.
+ The color 255, 0, 255 (purple/pink) will be interpreted as a blank space (transparent).
+ The output of the program is a .txt file with the same name as the original image (like cookie.bmp.cs); a macro file for 1x1 bricks that can be loaded with Ephialtes Macro saver.

IMPROVEMENTS:
+ Now works with the latest version (as of 2007-08-09) of Ephialtes' macro saver, meaning faster loading times and smaller files.

Special thanks goes to Ephialtes and all the other people who create and share add-ons.
