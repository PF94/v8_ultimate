"Thank Bushido the most for being the awesome guy that he is. Making add-ons and the Blockland Trading cards, and
now hes helping me, a noob, make this add-on, for my own glory. I also feal really special making this. But, I know people out there will no like it, but thats their problem.
Again. thank Bushido, not me. The coding was easy... it took me 30 seconds."
